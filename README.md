# lichtmusik

My plan is to help you writing code that generates beautiful music on linux shells.
What you need is python3, gcc and a lot of c skills.

If everything is checked you can go on writing a c file, that is outputting sampledata
in 96000 Hz 2 Channel 16 Bit to stdout. after that you can run the go.py script with
python3 to compile and run the c file and catch the sampledata to write it in a wavefile.

A lot of helpful c header files will spawn here in the near future.
